Around what time is crime most likely to happen?
What is the most crime-ridden neighborhood in SF?
What category of crime is most likely to happen?
What category of crime is least likely to happen?
What kind of resolutions are there for each crime?

The topic of crime is broad, especially in San Francisco. Some may find the topic intriguing; others might find it disturbing. As for myself, I want to know the answers to the questions above since the site does not directly answer them. In the database we get data which can solve these questions.
